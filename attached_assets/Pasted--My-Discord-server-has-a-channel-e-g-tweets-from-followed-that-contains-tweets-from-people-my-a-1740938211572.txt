 My Discord server has a channel (e.g., #tweets-from-followed) that contains tweets from people my agent should be tracking. I want to:
Simplify my Twitter connection file: Instead of using Twitter’s API to pull tweets from accounts my agent follows, rewrite the code to pull tweet text from messages in the #tweets-from-followed channel on my Discord server. Assume the tweets are posted as plain text or embedded links by a bot like TweetShift or MEE6. Extract only the tweet content (ignore metadata like timestamps or usernames unless part of the tweet text).

Update my Twitter actions file: Instead of posting tweets or comments to Twitter via its API, modify the code to send the agent’s responses (tweets or comments) as messages to a Discord channel (e.g., #agent-responses) on the same Discord server. Use the same Discord bot token for both reading and posting.
Here’s my setup:
I’m using Python on Replit.

I have a Discord bot token stored in a .env file as DISCORD_TOKEN.

My Discord server ID is [insert your server ID], and the channel IDs are [insert #tweets-from-followed ID] for reading tweets and [insert #agent-responses ID] for posting responses.

I’m using the discord.py library for Discord interactions.
Provide a simplified code example that:
Connects to Discord and listens for messages in the #tweets-from-followed channel.

Extracts tweet text from those messages.

Sends any agent-generated responses (e.g., a tweet or comment) to the #agent-responses channel.

Keeps the bot running continuously on Replit.
Avoid using Twitter’s API entirely. Focus only on Discord interactions. Include error handling and comments for clarity."
Example Code for Replit
Here’s a sample code snippet based on the prompt above. You’ll need to replace placeholders (like channel IDs) with your actual values:
python
import discord
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
TOKEN = os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN")

# Set up Discord client with intents
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True  # Enable reading message content
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

# Channel IDs (replace with your actual channel IDs)
TWEETS_CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678  # ID of #tweets-from-followed
RESPONSES_CHANNEL_ID = 987654321098765432  # ID of #agent-responses

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {client.user}")

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    # Ignore messages from the bot itself
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    # Check if message is in the tweets channel
    if message.channel.id == TWEETS_CHANNEL_ID:
        try:
            # Extract tweet text (assuming it's the message content or in an embed)
            tweet_text = message.content
            if message.embeds:  # If tweet is in an embed (e.g., from a bot)
                tweet_text = message.embeds[0].description

            print(f"Pulled tweet: {tweet_text}")

            # Example agent logic: generate a response (replace with your logic)
            agent_response = f"Agent reply to: {tweet_text[:50]}... - Great tweet!"

            # Send response to the responses channel
            response_channel = client.get_channel(RESPONSES_CHANNEL_ID)
            if response_channel:
                await response_channel.send(agent_response)
            else:
                print("Error: Response channel not found")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing message: {e}")

# Run the bot
try:
    client.run(TOKEN)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to start bot: {e}")
