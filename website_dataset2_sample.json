    "text": "KyberSwap Classic | KyberSwap Docs\nKyberSwap Classic Discontinuation\nOn 26 March 2024, the Classic protocol was discontinued. More details can be found here\nOverview\nKyberSwap Classic was conceived based on the observation that the standard AMM model was inadequate when it came to optimizing capital efficiency and price spreads. A one-size-fits-all pricing curve meant that capital was deployed across all prices regardless of the price correlation between unique token pairs. Moreover, AMM price spreads were market neutral as the same fees were charged regardless of market volatility.
